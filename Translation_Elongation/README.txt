Translation Elongation Model.pde
by Thomas E. Gorochowski (23/11/2013)

Simple examples of ribosome movement along an mRNA to illustrate some of 
the physical effects that can occur. Includes numerous options to alter
aspects of the simulation and show when certain aspects of a model break
down e.g., too short initation time can lead to collisions and the idea
that slow ramps may help reduce ribosome collisions.

To run this Processing 2.0+ is required. This can be downloaded from:

This software has been tested on a Mac, but should work fine on Windows
and Linux.

CONTROLS:
---------
   R      play/pause simulation
   C      clears the current simulation data
   -/+    decrease/increase initiation time
   S      switch between deterministic and stochastic modes
   9/0    decrease/increase noise
   I      toggle ribosome interactions
   T      toggle translational speed profile
   A      toggle average translation time statistic
   1/2/3  three scenarios: 1. Normal; 2. Normal + tRNA pool change; 3. Ramp
