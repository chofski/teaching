Translation Elongation Model
by Thomas E. Gorochowski (23/11/2013)

A simple model of ribosome movement along an mRNA to illustrate some of 
the physical effects that can occur. Includes numerous options to alter
aspects of the simulation and show when certain parts of the model break
down e.g., too short initiation time can lead to collisions and the idea
that slow codon ramps at the start of genes may help reduce ribosome 
collisions (improve efficiency).

To run this Processing 2.0+ is required. This can be downloaded from:

This software has been tested on a Mac, but should work fine on Windows
and Linux.

CONTROLS:
---------
   R        play/pause simulation
   C        clears the current simulation data
   -/+      decrease/increase initiation rate
   S        switch between deterministic and stochastic modes
   9/0      decrease/increase noise
   I        toggle ribosome interactions
   T        toggle translational speed profiles
   A        toggle average translation time statistic
   1/2/3/4  switch between three scenarios: 
              1. Normal; 2. Normal + tRNA pool change; 
              3. Normal + slow codon; 4. Ramp
